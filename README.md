# MemeAnalyzer: Memecoin Analysis DeFi Platform

A Clarity smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that provides comprehensive analysis tools for memecoins and tokens.

## Overview

MemeAnalyzer is a DeFi platform that helps users track, analyze, and monitor memecoin metrics. The platform enables data analysts to register tokens, update metrics, and create alerts when suspicious activity is detected. Users can subscribe to receive alerts about specific tokens.

## Features

- **Token Registration**: Register memecoin tokens for analysis and tracking
- **Metrics Tracking**: Monitor price, market cap, volume, liquidity, and holder count
- **Token Scoring**: Evaluate tokens based on social, technical, liquidity, and holder metrics
- **Alert System**: Generate and receive alerts for suspicious token activity
- **Subscription Model**: Subscribe to alerts for specific tokens
- **Analyst Marketplace**: Become an analyzer by staking tokens

## Contract Architecture

The contract is divided into 4 logical components:

1. **Initial Setup (Data Structures)**: Core data structures and constants
2. **Helper Functions & Registration**: Utility functions and token registration
3. **Core Functionality**: Metrics updating, verification, scoring, alerts, and subscriptions
4. **Admin Functions & Read Methods**: Analyzer management, fee settings, and read-only functions

## Key Data Structures

- `meme-tokens`: Stores basic token information and scores
- `token-metrics`: Stores current price and market metrics
- `token-alerts`: Stores alerts generated for each token
- `user-subscriptions`: Tracks user subscriptions to token alerts

## Roles

- **Owner**: The contract deployer with admin privileges
- **Analyzers**: Staked users who can update token metrics and generate alerts
- **Users**: Regular users who can subscribe to token alerts

## How to Use

### For Token Registration

```clarity
(contract-call? .meme-analyzer register-token 
  'SPNWZ5V2TPWGQGVDR6T7B6RQ4XMGZ4PXTEE0VQ0S 
  "CoolMeme" 
  "CMEME" 
  'SP2C2YFP12AJZB4MABJBAJ55XECVS7E4PMMZ89YZR 
  u1000000000)
```

### For Subscribing to Alerts

```clarity
(contract-call? .meme-analyzer subscribe 
  'SPNWZ5V2TPWGQGVDR6T7B6RQ4XMGZ4PXTEE0VQ0S)
```

### For Analyzers to Update Metrics

```clarity
(contract-call? .meme-analyzer update-metrics 
  'SPNWZ5V2TPWGQGVDR6T7B6RQ4XMGZ4PXTEE0VQ0S 
  u1000000 
  u10000000000 
  u500000 
  u2000000 
  u1500)
```

## Testing with Clarinet

1. Initialize a new project:
   ```
   clarinet new meme-analyzer && cd meme-analyzer
   ```

2. Add the contract to your project:
   ```
   clarinet contract new meme-analyzer
   ```

3. Copy the contract code into the generated file

4. Run tests:
   ```
   clarinet test
   ```

## Security Considerations

- The contract implements role-based access control
- Stake requirements for analyzers ensures quality data
- Owner privileges are limited to administrative functions
- All financial operations use the `unwrap!` pattern for safety

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with external oracles for real-time price data
- More sophisticated anomaly detection algorithms
- DAO governance for analyzer approval
- Enhanced token scoring models
- Integration with trading platforms
